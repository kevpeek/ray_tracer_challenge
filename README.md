# The Ray Tracer Challenge
Implementing my read through of [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge).

## Implementations
Currently I am implementing this in Kotlin, but I may add more implementations later. The Kotlin
implementation is located in the Kotlin subdirectory. Any additional implementations will likewise
have their own subdirectories.

See subdirectories for information about each implementation.
